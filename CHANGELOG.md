# Changelog

## 0.1.2 - Unreleased

- Started the 0.1.2 development cycle after the public 0.1.1 PyPI release.
- Added opt-in `manifold-check --explain` decision explanations for text, JSON,
  and Markdown regulation reports.
- Added `scripts/compare_eval_reports.py` to compare saved offline evaluator
  JSON reports and highlight summary, family, and case-level changes.
- Added `scripts/build_eval_replay_pack.py` to turn evaluator JSON plus corpus
  rows into compact Markdown or JSON replay packs for failed/selected cases.
- Added an exploratory EXP21 challenge corpus seed for harder non-claim
  development probes across negation scope, aliases, temporal binding,
  relation composition, qualifier overclaims, and all-bad near misses.
- Added evaluator taxonomy prefixes for EXP21 challenge families so challenge
  reports summarize by intended family instead of per-case fragments.
- Added reference-side negative relation support so candidates can preserve
  supplied negative evidence while positive counterclaims are clamped.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-18

- Published `manifold-guard==0.1.1` to PyPI and verified a clean public install
  with `manifold-check --version` plus `manifold-eval` passing 229 / 229 cases.
- Added `manifold-eval` filtering ergonomics with `--family`, `--case-id`,
  `--failures-only`, and `--list-families` for faster offline corpus triage.
- Tightened the optional embeddings extra to `sentence-transformers>=2.6.0,<3`
  and aligned docs-quality enforcement with the release-hardening policy.

- Rebrand the public package and CLI surface to ManifoldGuard (`manifold-guard`, `manifold-check`, `manifold-eval`) while keeping `mbt_ai_tools`, `mbt-check`, and `mbt-eval` as compatibility paths.
- Added a safe manual package build/publish workflow for TestPyPI and PyPI Trusted Publishing.
- Added Markdown evaluation report generation from regulator evaluation JSON artifacts.
- Added package publishing setup documentation for GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing.
- Added package-index installation and smoke-test documentation for TestPyPI and PyPI.
- Added a built-wheel install smoke check to package CI so distribution
  artifacts prove public API and CLI entry points before upload.
- Added per-candidate evaluator diagnostics for clamp summaries, literal drift,
  extracted relations, and safety decisions in offline regression reports.
- Expanded the offline regression corpus to 229 cases with boundary coverage for
  unsupported negation, relation direction swaps, and overclaim clamps.

## 0.1.0 Release Candidate 3 - 2026-06-14

- Added CSV audit export with `--format csv` for spreadsheet-friendly candidate review.
- Added `manifold-check --version` and package `__version__` for reproducible audit logs.
- Added a machine-readable product readiness manifest covering supported install modes, CLI formats, examples, CI gates, and support boundaries.
- Added contributor, security, support, and conduct documentation for product-grade project governance.
- Added structured GitHub issue forms and a pull request template for reproducible bug reports and claim-safe review.
- Added release checklist and quality gates docs for repeatable product-standard release decisions.
- Added Dependabot configuration for weekly GitHub Actions and Python packaging maintenance.
- Added docs-quality GitHub workflow to validate manifest JSON and referenced support/guide files.
- Added JSON schema + sample fixtures for report payloads, with CI validation in docs-quality workflow.
- Added local report fixture validator script to run JSON schema checks in CI and by developers.
- Added unified docs-quality checker script and switched CI workflow to the shared entrypoint.
- Added `scripts/preflight.py` as a one-command release preflight for docs checks and tests.
- Replaced placeholder package URLs with the public GitHub repository URL.
- Added project package URL metadata and propagated canonical project links into `docs/product_readiness_manifest.json`.
- Hardened `docs-quality` by enforcing parity between `pyproject.toml` package URLs and manifest `project.package_urls`.
- Added docs-quality regression coverage for package URL parity mismatches and drift.
- Added CI installability smoke coverage for `pip install -e .` and `pip install -e .[embeddings]` in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` with public entrypoint import checks.
- Hardened manifest validation with install-mode/CI-policy contract checks to prevent missing/duplicate dependency mode definitions.
- Extended `.github/workflows/docs-quality.yml` to run installability matrix checks for both `pip install -e . --no-deps` and `pip install -e .[embeddings]` with import and optional dependency availability assertions.
- Made docs-quality core installability smoke explicitly install runtime deps (`numpy`, `scipy`) before package entrypoint import checks.
- Tightened manifest CI-policy checks to enforce expected `core`/`embeddings` install command contracts and added matching regression tests.
- Enforced exact mode-name parity between `install_modes` and `ci_policy` in the manifest, with regression coverage for mismatches.
- Added docs-quality version contract validation so manifest, `pyproject.toml`, and `mbt_ai_tools/__init__.py` stay synchronized.
- Added changelog alignment enforcement so release notes must contain a section matching the declared package version in `pyproject.toml` / manifest.
- Added distribution metadata parity validation (`importlib.metadata.version`) to docs-quality with regression coverage for installed version match/mismatch behavior.
- Stabilized CLI version regression coverage by reading `mbt_ai_tools.__version__` from package metadata instead of hardcoding a fixed string.
- Added docs-quality workflow manual controls (`workflow_dispatch` inputs), scope-summary consistency checks for both release CI workflows, and a documented release evidence snapshot checklist for operator handoffs.
- Rejected `--token-shock` with `--no-embeddings` at CLI parse time and documented token-shock reporting as embedding-only.
- Added `scripts/release_evidence.py` to generate machine-readable release gate evidence in dry-run or execution mode.
- Added `scripts/validate_examples.py` and refreshed committed CLI JSONL, Markdown, and CSV examples to current offline output.
- Added `scripts/release_readiness.py` for an operator-facing readiness summary with explicit release blockers.
- Added `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` as the canonical maintainer release sequence from install modes through evidence, readiness, CI parity, and tagging.
- Added `scripts/release_check.py` as a one-command release evidence and readiness runner.
- Added `scripts/evaluate_regulator.py` for frozen offline corpus metrics and expected-behavior checks.
- Added a golden offline behavior regression test for key emit/block paths.
- Added CI upload of `release-evidence.json` as a workflow artifact in the core preflight path.
- Added taxonomy summaries and JSON artifact output for frozen offline regulator evaluation.
- Added `manifold-eval` as an installed console command for the offline frozen corpus evaluator.
- Added packaged regression corpus data so `manifold-eval` has a default corpus after installation.

## 0.1.0 Release Candidate 2 - 2026-06-11

- Added CLI JSON regulation reports with emitted candidate index, per-candidate scores, clamp summaries, relations, and negated relations.
- Added optional CLI token-shock reporting controls for regulation reports.
- Added `--output` for writing CLI output to files.
- Added `--input-jsonl` for batch regulation reports.
- Added `--summary` and `--fail-on-block` for CI-friendly batch guard usage.
- Added Markdown regulation and batch audit reports with `--format markdown`.
- Documented the JSON report schema under `docs/`.
- Added a CLI JSON report demo under `examples/`.
- Added a Markdown audit report demo under `examples/`.

## 0.1.0 Release Candidate 1 - 2026-06-10

- Kept the default package install offline-first by moving `sentence-transformers` behind the optional `.[embeddings]` extra.
- Added CI coverage for both dependency modes: full offline core tests and deterministic embeddings-mode smoke tests.
- Added clearer missing-dependency guidance for embedding-backed paths.
- Hardened unsupported negation handling across contractions, auxiliary verbs, future modals, and `has no` forms.
- Added configurable `token_shock_map` controls for `max_samples`, `top_k`, and output ordering.
- Documented install modes consistently across README, replication notes, and claims scope.
- Verified the local focused and full suites with `25 passed` and `26 passed`.

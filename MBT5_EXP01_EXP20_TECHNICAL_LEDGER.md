Geometry-only inference-time hallucination regulation for AI outputs.
This document records the ManifoldGuard experiment trail from EXP01 through EXP20. It is a technical ledger of completed work: mechanisms tested, failures found, patches added, regressions checked, and the frozen v11 result.
It is not a roadmap.
---
## 1. Project Definition
ManifoldGuard is an inference-time regulator for AI outputs.
It tests whether candidate AI outputs remain inside a supplied semantic and relational reference structure.
The regulator does not train the model.
The regulator does not fine-tune the model.
The regulator does not inspect model weights.
The regulator checks generated text after inference.
In this project, an AI hallucination is treated as semantic or relational drift:
```text
The output leaves the intended manifold and emits unsupported content.

That includes:

* wrong entities,
* wrong numbers,
* wrong units,
* wrong subject-object relations,
* reversed relation direction,
* unsupported negation,
* unsupported overclaiming,
* category substitution,
* candidate pools where every available answer is unsafe.

The regulator either emits the safest valid candidate or blocks/abstains when all candidates are unsafe.

⸻

2. Fact Model Used in This Work

The project uses this hierarchy:

Universe does facts.
Humans describe the universe.
AI describes human descriptions.

ManifoldGuard does not claim direct access to physical truth.

ManifoldGuard regulates AI text against supplied human reference descriptions, candidate sets, semantic manifolds, and relation maps.

The tested claim is not “AI fact checking”.

The tested claim is:

ManifoldGuard detects and blocks hallucinated AI outputs as semantic or relational drift from supplied reference structure.

⸻

3. Current Locked Result

Current frozen ledger:

MBT5_EXP20_combined_guarded_master_ledger_v11

Combined locked v11 result:

Candidates: 257
Cases:      53
Candidate-level confusion:
  [[TN, FP], [FN, TP]]
  [[97, 0], [0, 160]]
Accuracy:   1.0000
Precision:  1.0000
Recall:     1.0000
F1:         1.0000
Case-level:
  Correct: 53 / 53
  Emitted: 28
  Blocked: 25

There were no locked false positives and no locked false negatives in the EXP20 frozen ledger.

Across the locked ManifoldGuard v11 regression and unseen-holdout suites, every labelled hallucinated candidate was blocked and every labelled valid candidate was preserved.

⸻

4. Current Supported Claim

ManifoldGuard v11 blocks hallucinated AI outputs against supplied reference manifolds and relation constraints.
In the frozen EXP20 ledger, it achieved confusion [[97, 0], [0, 160]] over 257 labelled candidates across 53 cases.

That is the claim supported by the recorded experiments.

⸻

5. Core Mechanisms

5.1 Semantic Shock

Candidate outputs are embedded into semantic space.

ManifoldGuard measures distance from a reference center.

shock = Γ · ||candidate_embedding - reference_center||²

Lower shock means the output is closer to the reference manifold.

Higher shock means the output has drifted away from the reference manifold.

The reference center can be built from stable reference answers or from a reference manifold supplied by the user.

⸻

5.2 Geometric Median

For robust reference-centering, ManifoldGuard uses a geometric median rather than only an arithmetic mean.

This reduces sensitivity to outlier candidates.

The geometric median was computed with iterative Weiszfeld-style updates.

⸻

5.3 Internal Entropy

Multiple model outputs can be sampled for the same prompt.

ManifoldGuard embeds the outputs and measures the spread between them.

High internal entropy means unstable candidate generation.

Low internal entropy means candidate outputs are semantically consistent.

⸻

5.4 Token Shock

ManifoldGuard performs leave-one-out token analysis.

For each token, it removes the token, re-embeds the sentence, and measures whether removing that token reduces shock.

This localises the source of drift.

Example:

The capital of France is London.

Token-shock localisation identifies:

London

as the high-shock token.

⸻

5.5 Literal Drift Guards

Geometry alone misses close substitutions.

Example:

Water boils at 90 degrees Celsius at sea level.

This is semantically close to the correct statement but numerically wrong.

Literal guards protect:

* numbers,
* units,
* named entities,
* content tokens.

⸻

5.6 Content Token Clamp

The content token clamp blocks unsupported content tokens that geometry may tolerate.

This fixed failures such as:

The Moon is made mostly of wood.

where the output was not distant enough geometrically but contained unsupported content.

⸻

5.7 Overclaim Detection

ManifoldGuard blocks outputs that exceed the reference support.

Examples:

Gravity is fully solved by modern physics.
Quantum gravity is complete and experimentally verified.
A successful model is automatically the final truth.

These are treated as hallucinated when the reference only supports careful, limited descriptions.

⸻

5.8 Copular Relation Clamp

The copular relation clamp handles “X is Y” claims.

Examples:

The Sun is a planet.
Earth is flat.
A dog is a bird.
Rome is the capital city of France.

The clamp checks subject-object mappings against supplied relation structure.

⸻

5.9 Non-Copular Relation Clamp

The non-copular relation clamp handles verb relations.

Examples:

Earth orbits the Moon.
The Sun orbits Earth.
DNA contains the nucleus.
Heat produces friction.
Photosynthesis converts oxygen into carbon dioxide and water.

This catches relation direction errors and unsupported subject-object-verb mappings.

⸻

5.10 Coordinated Verb Subject Patch

Coordinated verb structures can share subjects across verbs.

Example:

Photosynthesis releases oxygen and stores light energy.

The initial non-copular clamp misread this and created a false positive.

EXP13C patched coordinated verb subject handling.

⸻

5.11 Reference Member Override

If a candidate is an exact member of the supplied reference set, geometry should not reject it unless a hard clamp fires.

This fixed the valid paraphrase false positive:

Italy's government is based in Rome.

⸻

5.12 Negated Positive Support Clamp

The negation clamp blocks unsupported negation of positively supported reference claims.

Examples:

Water is not liquid at room temperature.
Sound does not need a material medium to travel.
Scientific descriptions do not use measurements or predictions.
General relativity proves gravity has no connection to mass or energy.

If the reference positively supports a relation, an unsupported negation of that relation is blocked.

⸻

5.13 Abstention

When every candidate is unsafe, ManifoldGuard blocks instead of choosing the least-bad candidate.

This is essential because the least-bad hallucination is still a hallucination.

⸻

9. EXP20 Output Files

EXP20 generated:

mbt5_exp20_master_candidate_ledger.csv
mbt5_exp20_master_case_ledger.csv
mbt5_exp20_summary_metrics.csv
mbt5_exp20_case_summary.csv
mbt5_exp20_clamp_counts.csv
mbt5_exp20_failure_table.csv
mbt5_exp20_patch_lineage.csv

The failure table contained no locked false positives or false negatives.

10. Public README Boundary

The README should stay short.

It should state:

ManifoldGuard is a geometry-only inference-time hallucination regulator for AI outputs.

It should include the frozen EXP20 headline result.

It should link here for the full technical ledger.

The detailed experiment history belongs in this file, not in the README.

12. Usage Surface

Library usage:

from mbt_ai_tools import confidence_score, hallucination_risk, token_shock_map
text = "The capital of France is Paris."
score = confidence_score(text)
risk = hallucination_risk(text)
shocks = token_shock_map(text)
print(score)
print(risk)
print(shocks)

CLI usage:

manifold-check "The capital of France is Paris."

The CLI reports a confidence/risk label and a numeric internal entropy score.

13. Candidate Selection Mode

Candidate selection workflow:

1. Generate or supply candidate outputs.
2. Embed candidates and reference descriptions.
3. Compute semantic shock.
4. Compute literal drift.
5. Extract relation claims.
6. Apply clamps.
7. Rank safe candidates.
8. Emit the safest valid candidate, or block if all candidates are unsafe.

Example mixed candidate pool:

Prompt:
  What is the capital of France?
Candidates:
  The capital of France is London.
  The capital of France is Paris.
  The capital of France is Lyon.
ManifoldGuard action:
  emit "The capital of France is Paris."

Example all-bad candidate pool:

Prompt:
  What is the capital of France?
Candidates:
  The capital of France is London.
  The capital of France is Lyon.
  The capital of France is Berlin.
ManifoldGuard action:
  block

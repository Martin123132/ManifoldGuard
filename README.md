# MBT-5
**Geometry-only inference-time hallucination regulator for AI outputs.**
MBT-5 tests whether an AI output stays inside a supplied semantic and relational reference manifold.
It runs at inference time.
No training.  
No fine-tuning.  
No model-weight inspection.  
No hidden classifier.
The regulator checks candidate outputs and either:
1. emits the safest supported candidate, or
2. blocks / abstains when every candidate is unsafe.
## Core Claim
MBT-5 treats AI hallucination as **semantic or relational drift**.
A hallucination is not defined here as “lack of access to universal fact”.  
It is defined as the model leaving the intended answer manifold and producing unsupported content.
```text
Universe does facts.
Humans describe the universe.
AI describes human descriptions.
MBT-5 regulates AI descriptions against supplied human reference structure.

MBT-5 is therefore not a fact oracle.
It is an output regulator.

It tests whether an AI output remains consistent with the reference descriptions, candidate set, semantic manifold, and relation constraints it was given.

In the frozen EXP20 ledger, MBT-5 produced no locked false positives and no locked false negatives.

Supported claim:

MBT-5 v11 blocked hallucinated AI outputs against supplied reference manifolds and relation constraints. In the frozen EXP20 ledger, it achieved confusion [[97, 0], [0, 160]] over 257 labelled candidates across 53 cases.

What MBT-5 Checks

MBT-5 combines:

* semantic geometry
* internal consistency scoring
* token-level shock analysis
* literal drift guards
* entity / number / unit protection
* overclaim detection
* copular relation checks
* non-copular relation checks
* relation polarity checks
* unsupported negation clamps
* abstention when every candidate is unsafe

Examples of Blocked Drift

MBT-5 is designed to catch outputs such as:

The capital of France is London.
The Sun is a planet.
Earth is flat.
Water boils at 90 degrees Celsius at sea level.
Gravity is fully solved by modern physics.
Scientific descriptions do not use measurements.
DNA contains the nucleus.
The Sun orbits Earth.

These are treated as output-regulation failures: the candidate has left the supplied semantic or relational support structure.

Core Mechanisms

1. Semantic Shock

Candidate outputs are embedded into semantic space.

MBT-5 measures distance from the reference manifold:

shock = Γ · ||candidate_embedding - reference_center||²

Higher shock means stronger semantic drift.

2. Internal Entropy

Multiple candidate answers can be sampled.

MBT-5 measures disagreement between candidates in embedding space.

High internal entropy means the output set is unstable.

3. Token Shock

MBT-5 removes tokens one at a time and measures how much each token contributes to drift.

Example:

The capital of France is London.

Token shock localises to:

London

4. Literal Drift Guards

Geometry alone can miss small but important substitutions.

Example:

Water boils at 90 degrees Celsius at sea level.

This is semantically close to the supported statement, but the number is wrong.

MBT-5 therefore protects:

* numbers
* units
* named entities
* key content tokens

5. Relation Clamps

MBT-5 checks relation structure, not just semantic similarity.

Copular examples:

The Sun is a planet.
A dog is a bird.
Rome is the capital city of France.

Non-copular examples:

Earth orbits the Moon.
The Sun orbits Earth.
DNA contains the nucleus.
Heat produces friction.
Photosynthesis converts oxygen into carbon dioxide and water.

6. Negation Clamp

MBT-5 blocks unsupported negations of positive reference support.

Examples:

Water is not liquid at room temperature.
Sound does not need a material medium to travel.
Scientific descriptions do not use measurements or predictions.
General relativity proves gravity has no connection to mass or energy.

7. Abstention

When every candidate is unsafe, MBT-5 blocks instead of emitting the least-bad candidate.

Installation

pip install mbt-ai-tools

Basic Usage

from mbt_ai_tools import confidence_score, hallucination_risk, token_shock_map
text = "The capital of France is Paris."
score = confidence_score(text)
risk = hallucination_risk(text)
shocks = token_shock_map(text)
print(score)
print(risk)
print(shocks)

Candidate Regulation

```python
from mbt_ai_tools import regulate_candidates

references = [
    "The capital of France is Paris.",
    "Paris is the capital city of France.",
]
candidates = [
    "The capital of France is London.",
    "The capital of France is Paris.",
]

result = regulate_candidates(candidates, references)
print(result.action)        # emit
print(result.emitted_text)  # The capital of France is Paris.
```

For offline literal/relation-only checks, pass `use_embeddings=False`. The regulator still applies literal drift, relation, negation, overclaim, reference-member, and abstention clamps.

CLI

mbt-check "The capital of France is Paris."

The CLI reports a confidence / risk label and the numeric internal entropy score.
